      June 24th: Once I had a Pikachu Vmax. My friend traded some pokemon cards, one of was a really cool card. 
      We checked it out. We asked the expert at cards and coffee. He said 20p real 80p fake. We sent it to PSA to authenticaet the card.
      A few days ago, we found out it's real! (grade 5)
